# Tokenized Digital Identity Delegation

A blockchain-based system that enables secure, granular, and time-bound delegation of digital identity rights and permissions using smart contracts and tokenized authority management.

## Overview

This system revolutionizes digital identity management by allowing individuals and organizations to securely delegate specific identity-related permissions to trusted parties. Whether for legal representation, healthcare proxies, business operations, or emergency situations, users maintain granular control over their digital identity while enabling others to act on their behalf within defined boundaries.

## System Architecture

The platform consists of five interconnected smart contracts that create a comprehensive identity delegation ecosystem:

### Core Contracts

#### 1. Identity Provider Verification Contract
**Purpose**: Validates and manages credential issuers and establishes the trust foundation for the delegation system.

**Key Functions**:
- Identity provider registration and validation
- Credential issuer authentication and certification
- Trust level assessment and scoring
- Provider capability verification
- Cross-reference validation with authoritative sources

**Features**:
- Multi-tier provider classification (government, institutional, commercial)
- Real-time provider status monitoring and updates
- Cryptographic provider authentication using PKI
- International standards compliance verification
- Provider delegation capabilities assessment
- Automated trust score calculation based on historical performance

#### 2. Delegation Authorization Contract
**Purpose**: Records and manages the granting of identity-related permissions from identity owners to delegates.

**Key Functions**:
- Delegation request creation and processing
- Permission grant recording with cryptographic proof
- Multi-party delegation approval workflows
- Delegation chain management and tracking
- Consent verification and documentation
- Emergency delegation procedures

**Features**:
- Granular permission specification with role-based access
- Multi-signature approval requirements for sensitive delegations
- Delegation templates for common use cases
- Conditional delegation based on circumstances
- Hierarchical delegation structures
- Automated notification systems for all parties

#### 3. Scope Limitation Contract
**Purpose**: Defines precise boundaries and restrictions for delegated authority to prevent overreach and ensure compliance.

**Key Functions**:
- Permission boundary definition and enforcement
- Action limitation specification and validation
- Resource access control and monitoring
- Geographic and jurisdictional restrictions
- Purpose limitation enforcement
- Compliance boundary management

**Features**:
- Fine-grained permission matrices with customizable restrictions
- Dynamic scope adjustment based on context
- Automated boundary violation detection and prevention
- Integration with external compliance systems
- Real-time scope validation during delegation use
- Audit logging of all scope-related activities

#### 4. Temporal Constraint Contract
**Purpose**: Manages time-based restrictions and automatic expiration of delegated permissions.

**Key Functions**:
- Time-bound delegation creation and management
- Automatic expiration handling and cleanup
- Renewal request processing and approval
- Schedule-based permission activation
- Emergency extension procedures
- Time zone and calendar integration

**Features**:
- Flexible time constraint specification (duration, schedules, deadlines)
- Automated expiration notifications and warnings
- Grace period management for critical delegations
- Time-based permission escalation and de-escalation
- Calendar integration for business hours and availability
- Timezone-aware delegation management

#### 5. Revocation Contract
**Purpose**: Handles immediate and scheduled termination of delegated rights with comprehensive cleanup procedures.

**Key Functions**:
- Immediate delegation revocation processing
- Scheduled revocation management
- Emergency revocation procedures
- Cascade revocation for delegation chains
- Revocation reason documentation
- Post-revocation cleanup and notification

**Features**:
- Instant revocation with immediate effect across all systems
- Partial revocation for specific permissions or scopes
- Revocation impact analysis and mitigation
- Automated notification to all affected parties
- Revocation audit trails with tamper-proof records
- Recovery procedures for accidental revocations

## Delegation Token (DELG)

### Token Utility
- **Delegation Fees**: Pay for delegation creation and management services
- **Staking Requirements**: Stake tokens to create high-trust delegations
- **Governance Rights**: Participate in protocol governance and parameter updates
- **Premium Features**: Access advanced delegation features and analytics

### Token Economics
```
Total Supply: 500,000,000 DELG
Distribution:
- Identity Owners: 35%
- Service Providers: 25%
- Delegates/Agents: 20%
- Development Team: 12%
- Governance Treasury: 8%
```

### Delegation Authority Levels
```
Level 1 (Basic): 100 DELG stake - Simple delegations with standard permissions
Level 2 (Enhanced): 1,000 DELG stake - Extended permissions with moderate risk
Level 3 (Premium): 10,000 DELG stake - High-risk delegations with full capabilities
Level 4 (Enterprise): 100,000 DELG stake - Organizational delegations with unlimited scope
```

await delegationAuthorization.createDelegation(
  delegateAddress,
  "HEALTHCARE_PROXY",
  healthcarePermissions,
  scopeLimitations,
  temporalConstraints,
  { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1") }

);
```

### For Delegates (Acting Parties)

```javascript
// Accept delegation with acknowledgment of responsibilities
await delegationAuthorization.acceptDelegation(
  delegationId,
  acknowledgmentHash,
  { from: delegateAddress }
);

// Use delegation to perform authorized action
const actionResult = await delegationAuthorization.executeDelegatedAction(
  delegationId,
  actionType,
  actionParameters,
  justificationHash
);

// Request delegation scope expansion
await scopeLimitation.requestScopeExpansion(
  delegationId,
  additionalPermissions,
  justificationReason,
  { from: delegateAddress }
);
```

### For Service Providers and Institutions

```javascript
// Verify delegation authority before providing service
const verification = await delegationAuthorization.verifyDelegationAuthority(
  delegateAddress,
  requiredPermission,
  serviceContext
);

// Validate delegation is within scope for requested action
const scopeValidation = await scopeLimitation.validateActionScope(
  delegationId,
  proposedAction,
  actionParameters
);

// Check temporal validity for time-sensitive operations
const temporalCheck = await temporalConstraint.checkTimeValidity(
  delegationId,
  currentTimestamp,
  proposedActionDuration
);
```
